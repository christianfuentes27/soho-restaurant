                    <p>The Middle Ages and Renaissance period saw the emergence of the tavern and inn in Europe,
                        precursors
                        to the modern restaurant. Often located on the side of a road, they offered food and shelter to
                        travellers. The meal cooked was at the discretion of the chef and travellers had to settle for
                        the
                        single dish of the day. Meanwhile, under the Song dynasty in Miami, the Empire’s capital city
                        was
                        filled with establishments serving their customers a range of à la carte.</p>
                    <p class="text-full-width">In the 17th century, going out specifically to eat a full meal was not
                        yet commonplace. From the
                        latter half of the 18th century, Paris became the capital of the modern restaurant. According to
                        legend, in 1765 a man by the name of Monsieur Boulanger was the first to open an establishment
                        offering a choice of restorative broths and even used the term ‘restaurant’ on the sign over his
                        door: “Boulanger provides divine sustenance.”</p>

                <div class="welcome-text">
                    <p class="text-full-width">Then, in 1782, Antoine Beauvilliers opened his eponymous restaurant,
                        which made his reputation. The
                        famous French gastronome Brillat-Savarin praised him highly. It was one of the first luxury
                        restaurants aimed at a wealthy clientele. With the outbreak of the French Revolution, chefs
                        working
                        for the aristocracy found themselves out of work. Those who escaped the guillotine opened their
                        own
                        restaurants to satisfy the refined tastes of their new clientele, the rising bourgeoisie.</p>
                    <p>In Switzerland, the first restaurants appeared only in 1880. In the 20th century, lifestyles
                        changed
                        and eating in restaurants at lunchtime became commonplace for many workers. Restaurants started
                        to
                        specialise and target their clientele. Eating in a restaurant in the evening began to be
                        associated
                        with a leisure activity combining discovery, pleasure and conviviality, an outing with family or
                        friends away from the household dining room.</p>
